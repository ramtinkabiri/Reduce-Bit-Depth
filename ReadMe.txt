-Image Bit Depth Reduction:
This MATLAB file reduces the bit depth of a sample image using f2j and j2f quantization techniques.
The bit depths of the processed images are 256, 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, and 2.

-Sample Image:
The code uses a sample image (cameraman.tif). Replace it with your own image if desired.

-Results:
The results are displayed in a single figure.

-Acknowledgments:
The sample image used in this project is sourced from researchgate.
